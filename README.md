Hello I am Tanmay,

In this EDA ( Explanatory Data Anlaysis ) Project, I have used dataset "hour.csv". in which i have used major functions, which are used for analysis from pandas. 
and then for visualization and plotting i have moved to seaborn and matplotlib.

functions used from pandas:
head()
mean()
median()
std()
min()
max()
describe()
.loc[]
groupby()

function from matplotlib and seaborn:
plotting functions, scatter plot
show()
legend()
boxplot() etc.
